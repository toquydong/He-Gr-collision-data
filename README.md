There are two files in this repository: crossdepthHe40T50G2planes.txt  and 

The CSV file:

The csv file contains the collision data of 40 He atoms and a Graphene wall. The file is obtained by post processing the raw data issued from LAMMPS. There are 13 columns in the data
1: Index of the collision, 2: atom Id (from 1 to 40), 3: the beginning time of the collision Timein, 4: incoming velocity Vx, 5: incoming velocity Vy, 6: incoming velocity Vz
7: the ending time of the collision Timeout, 8: outgoing velocity Vx, 9: outgoing velocity Vy, 10: outgoing velocity Vz, 11: the surface displacement along x, 
12: the surface displacement along y, 13: the residence time (= column 7 - column 3)
